tGame was the first project I would really call my own. I started it when I was really new to the whole programming thing and had no concept of good practices, just unfiltered motivation and imagination.

## Some background info

This whole project began as the base for a roguelike dungeon crawler that I wanted to make. I had just finished my first year of highschool and learned to code through mobile learning apps and the school's Programming Club, in which our final project in the beginner module was also a game using PyGame (I made a Whack-A-Mole clone). This lay the foundation of how I wanted to structure the so-called "game engine".

I got as far as the example shooter in the GitHub repo, before I stopped for the first time. School was picking up, and using Repl.it began to get unwieldy. Mind you, I was coding on my 15 year old Windows 7 PC (which I owe so many great memories to) and my phone, so testing things like reading form the input buffer and drawing to the terminal became rather difficult. Additionally, when I came back to the project a couple months later, Repl.it had dropped most of the free features and at the same time, required upgrading every app to a new system which was really, really slow for some reason.

Anyways, this combination of things kind of made me leave tGame as it was, a half-finished skeleton.

## The revival

Come Web Development 10-12, tGame made it's come back through Python lessons we had towards the end of the year (we did not actually do any WebDev with Python).

Rather than the standard prompts for input for our text-based rpg project, I really wanted to just use key input (arrow keys + enter for choices), so I booted up the repl and copy-pasted the files over.

(to be continued)

## What's next

I am mostly done working on the base project.
However, I'll probably always come back to this every once in a while because the command-line is just a really cool style.
