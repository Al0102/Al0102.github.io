What happens when you have no motivation to work on long term projects? Join a game jam with your friend so you're forced to do something, and you don't have to worry about bugs and doodle art because "I DID IT IN 3 DAYS DARN IT!".

## The Beginnings

I was hanging out with [grcubes](https://grcubes.itch.io/) between classes and saw him wokring on a space-themed bullet hell. Not for a game jam, but afterwards they mentioned an upcoming "Mini Jame Gam" that weekend that was going to make good resume padder.

First of all, who could not want to participate in a game jam called Jame Gam??? Second, I knew I was getting nowhere with my longer projects, and deadlines and partners make great motivation.

I bothered my friend for a team up and of course my incredible charisma convinced him to say yes.

## What's next?

Honestly, we probably won't work on it a great deal for while, considering that we have job applications, school (stay tuned for a game built in Java for an Object-Oriented Programming course), and life to attend to. However, we do have ideas and prototypes for quite a few more minigames, as well as plans to actually convert Berry-O-Ware into a WarioWare style arcade game.

I love the wacky, fast-paced adventures that are the WarioWare games and I 've been wanting to make one for while. So, I might just continue building my Godot prototypes into a full game (definitely not procrastinating Fishing Fragments). Also, by recreating the entire thing I can actually show people (ahem, EA? Demonware? Ninetendo???) that I contributed more than art and sound effects (although those are equally if not more important imo).
